Description: This is a re-write of the Peaks package maintained by
    M.Kondrin based upon a C library written by Miroslav Morhac
    written to use current build techniques. I did add functions to
    estimate the Gaussian parameters from a centroid and then to
    extract and fit the peak to a Gaussian distribution. This is
    a helpful way to find the centroid of a pseudo-Gaussian peak
    with a measurable precison.
