# rPeaks

This is a re-write of the R Peaks package maintained by M.Kondrin
based upon a C library written by Miroslav Morhac. rPeaks was
written to use current build techniques from RStudio to build.

The documentation is automatically generated from tags included in the
source files and processed by roxygen2. I did this beacuse of issues
with R-3.2.0 using the Peaks package from CRAN,
